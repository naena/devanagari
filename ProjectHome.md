Romanized Devanagari is a convenient alphabet to write Pali so that it can be typed, copied or pasted inside any application without degradation that happens to current romanized Pali. The alphabet is based on Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1 character set) -- the Unicode block that western European languages use.

Communicating in Devanagari over the Internet is difficult for the
following reasons:

  1. Unicode requires that you have Unicode font.
  1. The glyphs should be correctly positioned on the Unicode table (notice the inaccuracies on Google)
  1. You should learn a new keyboard
  1. Most importantly, the person at the other end should have everything above.

In addition:
One cannot read Unicode on a public computer outside India

A secondary romanized alphabet for Devanagari is now available. It is NOT
anglicized Devanagari which carries a tinge of elitist snobbery with it
(48 years after independence!).

Icelandic inspired this alphabet. Romanized Devanagari has rules similar to Dutch and Italian. It could be used even as a replacement alphabet to the traditional script. This would bring Devanagari at par with the Western European languages -- a definite help for the Devanagari-only
group to enter the cyber world.
